<h1>Accessibility and open design</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am not an accessibility expert! I just like making things that everyone can use.</p>
<p>But until 2015, I didn't actually know <em>anything</em> about accessibility.</p>

<h2>Learn you an assistive technology (AT) for great good</h2>
<p>Accessibility ≠ screen readers!  But that said, a screen reader is a freely available AT that offers a great perspective on how some people use the technology we design and build.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891">Google's Web Accessibility course on Udacity</a> is extremely well-done, and among other things, teaches you how to use a screen reader. (Ignore all the advertising about it being for "advanced developers"&mdash;you only need basic HTML and CSS knowledge for most of the class, and the parts that require JavaScript knowledge are easy to skip.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> is an excellent open-source screen reader for Microsoft Windows. The <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/nvda/">NVDA tutorial by WebAIM</a> pairs well with it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/">VoiceOver</a> is an excellent screen-reader built into MacOS and OS X, and it comes with a great built-in tutorial.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/">Orca</a> is an open-source screen reader for Linux, although I've never used it myself.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inclusivity vs. accessibility</h2>
<p>Providing a tabular alternative to a line graph that's only visible to screen-reader users may make that graph <em>accessible</em>, but does it make it <em>inclusive</em>?</p>

<h2>Allowing for customization</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes it's very hard to deal with <em>every</em> possible impairment.
  For instance, a high contrast ratio can make content more readable for
  most folks with visual impairments, but for individuals with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irlen_syndrome">Irlen syndrome</a>
  it can do the opposite.
</p>
<p>
  In this case, try to use open standards that allow users to customize your
  design via third-party tooling.
